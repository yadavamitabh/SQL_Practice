This repository contains my end-to-end SQL practice work using the Superstore Sales dataset, a rich, multi-dimensional dataset simulating real-world retail transactions. The project showcases my ability to design, query, and analyze relational data, applying both foundational and advanced SQL concepts to generate actionable insights.
